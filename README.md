# Deneb

Deneb is a community firmware-mod project for the UltiMaker 2+ Connect. The goal is to make the printer more local-first, more responsive, and less resource-taxed while preserving safety-critical behavior and a path back to official UltiMaker firmware.

This repository is private while the project is being organized.

## Current Priority

1. Keep the public/project repo legally clean.
2. Build `Deneb_get_started.img` so users can enable SSH and install the `.deneb` package lane from the stock USB firmware-update UI.
3. Measure real RAM, CPU, boot, storage, service, and hardware behavior from the live printer.
4. Prioritize boot-time and touchscreen responsiveness work based on live-device evidence.
5. Add web UI, LAN printing, slicer compatibility, OS/service modernization, and Marlin work only after the baseline and UI path are understood.

## Project Boundary

This repository must not contain UltiMaker firmware images, extracted root filesystems, proprietary application source, recovered/decompiled vendor code, private keys, device secrets, or generated modified firmware images.

Users/developers must supply their own firmware image or printer for local analysis. Deneb should publish original code, documentation, build scripts, installer scripts, compatibility layers, and minimal patch/transformation logic only where needed.

## Name

The stock firmware/application layer appears to use the codename `Cygnus`. Cygnus is both a mythological swan and a northern constellation, which fits a cloud-first printer identity. Deneb is the brightest star in Cygnus. The name keeps a respectful relationship to that lineage while making clear this is a separate community mod, not official UltiMaker firmware.

## License

Original Deneb project files are intended to be licensed under MPL-2.0 unless a file or component says otherwise. This license does not apply to UltiMaker firmware, extracted firmware files, user-supplied device files, or third-party components with their own licenses.

## Safety

This project can affect printer networking, motion, heating, updates, and diagnostics. Treat every change as hardware-affecting until proven otherwise. Do not expose unauthenticated heat, motion, print, or raw G-code controls on untrusted networks.
